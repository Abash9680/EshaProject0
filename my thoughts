My thought process for my personal Tamagotchi game.

First I googled Tamagotchi's to even have a clue of what this game looked like.
I didn't go with an actual tamagotchi character so I used my own Maltese dog as a character..Prince the Tamagotchi.
I googled gifs of maltese dogs playing cause my game consist of him playing. 
I now have to find other pics of other things for him to do such as being bored or sleeping to change up pics.
I was able to add in the buttons, next step is the eventListeners and count.
Wish me luck! 












Added back the start ,pause and stop buttons for game
