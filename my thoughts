My thought process for my personal Tamagotchi game.

First I googled Tamagotchi's to even have a clue of what this game looked like.
I didn't go with an actual tamagotchi character so I used my own Maltese dog as a character..Prince the Tamagotchi.
I googled gifs of maltese dogs playing cause my game consist of him playing. 
I now have to find other pics of other things for him to do such as being bored or sleeping to change up pics.
I was able to add in the buttons, next step is the eventListeners and count.
Wish me luck! 


added in my id'd for my count for the different buttons
added in my first function for start 
trying to setInterval for the games basic times and clicks 

Added back the start ,pause and stop buttons for game
Tried to add in footer and I'm stumped at the closing part of the footer, or maybe I added the href wrong 

Just added in my Linkedin url and the linked work on my console side.
